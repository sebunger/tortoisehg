	Settings dialog

The Settings dialog is used to configure both TortoiseHg and the
underlying Mercurial DVCS.  Since TortoiseHg uses Mercurial's underlying
configuration system to store and retrieve its settings, these are
essentially the same thing.

Mercurial on Windows has a three-tier configuration system.

1) A site-wide configuration file in
   :file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\Mercurial.ini`
   This file is read first and thus has the lowest priority.
2) A per-user configuration file in
   :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Mercurial.ini`
   This file is read second and thus can override settings in the
   site-wide configuration file.
3) A per-repository configuration file in :file:`repo-root\\.hg\\hgrc` This
   file is read last and can override site-wide and user global settings.

The site-wide file can be overwritten on upgrades so it is recommended
that you do not make changes to this file.  Instead, you should make
changes to your user :file:`Mercurial.ini` and/or the repository
:file:`hgrc` file.  The TortoiseHg Settings dialog enforces this
suggestion by only operating in two modes:

Global
	edits your user :file:`Mercurial.ini` file
Repository
	edits a repository :file:`.hg/hgrc` file

You may toggle between the two modes using the combo box at the top of
the dialog, or directly edit the file in your configured visual editor.

Most TortoiseHg users will want to store all configurables in their
global user settings, and only use the repository hgrc to store paths
(remote repository aliases) and web settings, though it is possible to
override many configurables per-repository (a common example is to
configure a username for use in a specific repository).  Also note that
the user and repository configuration files may not exist until you run
the Settings dialog for the first time.

Tabs
====

The Settings tool is a tabbed application.

Each tab corresponds roughly to a section of your :file:`Mercurial.ini`
file, though there is a certain amount of overlap. Some sections were
split across multiple tabs for clarity.

Every tab but :guilabel:`Sync` has the same format, a list of
configurable options with a drop-down combo box with possible values and
a history of options you have used for that setting. The configurable
name (label) has a tooltip which describes in more detail what you are
configuring and its default value.  The description of the currently
focused configurable is also shown in a text box at the bottom of the
dialog.

Please consult the Mercurial wiki for more detailed information about
these configurables (except for the first three tabs:
:guilabel:`TortoiseHg`, :guilabel:`Commit`, :guilabel:`Changelog`, which
are specific to TortoiseHg).

.. module:: TortoiseHg.settings
	:synopsis: Dialog used to set general TortoiseHg preferences

TortoiseHg
----------

:guilabel:`UI Language:`
	Specify your preferred user interface language (restart needed)

:guilabel:`3-way Merge Tool:`
	Graphical merge program for resolving merge conflicts.  If left
	unspecified, Mercurial will use the first applicable tool it finds
	on your system or use its internal merge tool that leaves conflict
	markers in place.  Chose :guilabel:`internal:merge` to force
	conflict markers, :guilabel:`internal:prompt` to always select local
	or other, or :guilabel:`internal:dump` to leave files in the working
	directory for manual merging.

:guilabel:`Visual Diff Tool:`
	Specify visual diff tool as described in the [merge-tools] section
	of your Mercurial configuration files.  If left unspecified,
	TortoiseHg will use the selected merge tool. Failing that it uses
	the first applicable tool it finds.

:guilabel:`Visual Editor:`
	Specify visual editor, as described in the ``[editor-tools]`` section
	of your Mercurial configuration files.  If left unspecified, TortoiseHg
	will use the first applicable tool it finds.

:guilabel:`Shell:`
	Specify the command to launch your preferred terminal shell
	application. If the value includes the string ``%(reponame)s``, the
	name of the repository will be substituted in place of
	``%(reponame)s``. Similarly, ``%(root)s`` will be the full path to
	the repository. (restart needed)

	Default, Windows:
	  ``cmd.exe /K title %(reponame)s``
	Default, OS X:
	  not set
	Default, other:
	  ``xterm -T "%(reponame)s"``

:guilabel:`Immediate Operations:`
	Space separated list of shell operations you would like to be
	performed immediately, without user interaction. Commands are "add
	remove revert forget". Default: None (leave blank)

:guilabel:`Tab Width:`
	Specify the number of spaces that tabs expand to in various
	TortoiseHg windows. Default: 8

:guilabel:`Force Repo Tab:`
	Always show repo tabs, even for a single repo. Default: False

:guilabel:`Monitor Repo Changes:`
	Specify the target filesystem where TortoiseHg monitors changes.
	Default: localonly

:guilabel:`Max Diff Size:`
	The maximum size file (in KB) that TortoiseHg will
	show changes for in the changelog, status, and commit windows.
	A value of zero implies no limit.  Default: 1024 (1MB).

:guilabel:`Fork GUI:`
	When running thg from the command line, fork a background process
	to run graphical dialogs. Default: True.

:guilabel:`Full Path Title:`
	Show a full directory path of the repository in the dialog title
	instead of just the root directory name.  Default: False

:guilabel:`Auto-resolve merges:`
	Indicates whether TortoiseHg should attempt to automatically resolve
	changes from both sides to the same file, and only report merge
	conflicts when this is not possible. When False, all files with
	changes on both sides of the merge will report as conflicting, even
	if the edits are to different parts of the file. In either case, when
	conflicts occur, the user will be invited to review and resolve
	changes manually. Default: True.

:guilabel:`New Repo Skeleton:`
	If specified, files in the directory, e.g. ``.hgignore``, are copied
	to the newly-created repository.

	Select when the working directory status list will be refreshed:

	``auto`` : default
	  let TortoiseHg decide when to refresh the working directory status

	TortoiseHg. Valid settings values are:

	``never`` :
	  Do not update the Issue Tracker state automatically.
	``commit`` :
	  Update the Issue Tracker state after a successful commit.

	Default: never

:guilabel:`Changeset Link:`
	A "template string" that, when set, turns the revision number and
	short hashes that are shown on the revision panels into links.
	The "template string" uses a "mercurial template"-like syntax that
	currently accepts two template expressions:

	``{node|short}`` :
	  replaced by the 12 digit revision id (note that ``{node}`` on its
	  own is currently unsupported).
	``{rev}`` :
	  replaced by the revision number.

	For example, in order to link to bitbucket commit pages you can set
	this to: ``https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/commits/{node|short}``
