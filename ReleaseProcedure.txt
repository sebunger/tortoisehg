Steps for making a release:

* hg -R hg status -ar --rev 1.6:tip  # find new files that WiX needs to know about
* pull latest translations from Launchpad, dropping location information (msgcat --no-location)
* set revision number in doc/source/conf.py
* tag stable branches of thg and shellext repos, push
* build release installer
* commit extension versions, tag, push thg-winbuild
* create and upload a tarball (python setup.py sdist)
* upload installer to bitbucket
* update thg-html latest.dat, curversion.txt
* update URLs and front page of thg-web
* regen thg-web, commit thg-html, push
* wiki: Move FixedBugs or upcoming-release-notes to ReleaseNotes, empty FixedBugs

Post Major Release:
* Increment minimum Mercurial version in tortoisehg/util/hgversion.py
* Sweep through code and remove hacks for older Mercurial releases (1 yr)
